In JavaScript, the "global object" is a special object that contains variables and functions accessible from anywhere in your code, and in a web browser environment, this global object is specifically called the "window object" - meaning that when you access a global variable in a browser, you're essentially accessing a property of the window object;. 
Key points about global object and window object:
Function: The global object provides a way to access variables and functions globally throughout your JavaScript code. 
Browser specific: In a web browser, the global object is referred to as the "window object". 
Accessing properties: To access a global variable in a browser, you can use the syntax window.variableName. 
Example:
Code

    var myGlobalVariable = "Hello"; // This is a global variable, essentially a property of the window object

    console.log(window.myGlobalVariable); // Outputs: "Hello" [1, 2, 5]
